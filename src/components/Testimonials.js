          "Gaby and Taylor gave me the confidence I needed to negotiate my first
          job offer in tech! Through their workshop, I learned how to navigate
          my first offer and successfully ask for more. I negotiated a &nbsp;
          <span>X% increase over my initial offer</span> and it would not have
          been possible without Gaby and Taylor! &nbsp;
          <span>I’m so happy they gave me the guidance I needed!</span>"

          "The negotiation process was very difficult and slightly confusing,
          but I was happy to have Gaby to turn to. She helped me evaluate two
          offers I was torn between and &nbsp;
          <span>gave me the confidence to continue forward</span> with my
          decision, and even ask for a <span>$10K signing bonus!</span>"

          "....Taylor & Gaby were harder on me than the actual recruiter, so by
          the time I had the conversation I was so nervous about, I was so
          ready..."

        <p>
          “I’d spent all this time perfecting the art of the interview, but when
          it came to negotiation, I’d never done it before and the mere idea of
          it would send me into a burst of nervous laughter. Taylor and Gaby
          &nbsp;
          <span>armed me with concrete data, tips, and scripts</span> detailing
          what to say at each step in the process from that initial phone screen
          with a recruiter to working out that final compensation package. I
          went from too scared to even think about negotiating to &nbsp;
          <span>securing a $10k signing bonus right off the bat</span>. The
          whole experience turned every fear and concern I had on its head and
          &nbsp;
          <span>I feel exceptionally confident</span> that when I need to
          negotiate again in the future, <span>I’ll crush it.</span>”

          "The idea of negotiating was very scary and overwhelming, but Taylor
          made the process manageable. She patiently and thoroughly helped me
          shore up my weaknesses and taught me techniques to &nbsp;
          <span>prepare for every possible outcome</span>. I really appreciated
          the methodical way she lowered my anxiety. In the end, I successfully
          negotiated &nbsp;
          <span>$5K more in base salary and a $10K signing bonus.</span>"

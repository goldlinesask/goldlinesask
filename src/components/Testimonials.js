          "Gaby and Taylor gave me the confidence I needed to negotiate my first job offer in tech! Through their workshop, I learned how to navigate my first offer and successfully ask for more. I negotiated a <span>X% increase over my initial offer</span> and it would not have been possible without Gaby and Taylor! <span>Iâ€™m so happy they gave me the guidance I needed!</span>"

          "The idea of negotiating was very scary and overwhelming, but Taylor made the process manageable. She patiently and thoroughly helped me shore up my weaknesses and taught me techniques to <span>prepare for every possible outcome</span>. I really appreciated the methodical way she lowered my anxiety. In the end, I successfully negotiated <span>$5K more in base salary and a $10K signing bonus.</span>"

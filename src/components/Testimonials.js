        <h4>Support Engineer</h4>

          "Gaby and Taylor gave me the confidence I needed to negotiate my first job offer in tech! Through their workshop, I learned how to navigate my first offer and successfully ask for more. I negotiated a <strong>X% increase over my initial offer</strong> and it would not have been possible without Gaby and Taylor! <strong>Iâ€™m so happy they gave me the guidance I needed!</strong>"

She patiently and thoroughly helped me shore up my weaknesses and taught me techniques to <strong>prepare for every possible outcome</strong>.

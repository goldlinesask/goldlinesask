        <h4>Full-Stack/UI Engineer</h4>
        <p>
          "Taylor patiently and thoroughly helped me shore up my
          weaknesses in my negotiation technique. She made the
          negotiation process something I could manage, giving me
          techniques to walk through each possibility step-by-step.
          I really appreciated the methodical way she lowered my anxiety
          by preparing me for every outcome. In the end, I successfully
          negotiated $5K more in base salary and a $10K signing bonus."
